                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>
                        Solidarity for Developing Communities (SOLID), established in 1993 in Berhampur, Odisha, began its
                        foray into education by adopting Anganwadis. Over 29 years, this initiative has grown into the all-inclusive 
                        KASH Project Campus. Inaugurated in 2003, the Karuna Shanti (+2 Science) Residential Campus now enters its 20th year,
                        providing crucial higher education to Adivasi, Dalit, and OBC students from the districts of Ganjam, Gajapati, Kandhamal, & Rayagada.

                    <h3>Our Leadership</h3>
                    <p>
                        Late Shri. Bijayananda Singh, our founder, was a dedicated social worker and 
                        keen educationist whose futuristic vision and strong leadership guided this institution 
                        to its present glory. His clear convictions and dedication have been the guiding light
                        behind our growth. Today, Mr. Debasish Pattnaik continues this legacy as the Current Secretary 
                        and Executive Director, leading both SOLID and KASH towards new heights.
