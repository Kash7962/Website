<p>
    The Programme Project Campus has a remarkable track record of consistently achieving 100% results in the years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and until 2018, showcasing the 
    institution’s commitment to academic excellence. However, due to the pandemic, the results were lower in 2019 and until 2020. Despite the challenging times, the institution
    bounced back with flying colors in 2021, recording 100% results once again. Established in 2003, the institution has been steadfastly working towards its mission of guiding
    and empowering students towards excellence.

    Examination schedules
</p>
<p>
    ★ Faculty prepares a detailed training plan for the academic year. <br>
    ★ Formulates a comprehensive micro schedule for the students accordingly. <br>
    ★ This is followed in synchrony across KASH Higher secondary Project campus. <br>
    ★ To get uniformity in ranking, the common examination approach brings a sense of competition of the final examination scenario. <br>
