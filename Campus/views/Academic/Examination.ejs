                    The Programme Project Campus has a remarkable track record of consistently achieving 100% results in the years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and until 2018, showcasing the institution’s commitment to academic excellence. However, due to the pandemic, the results were lower in 2019 and until 2020. Despite the challenging times, the institution bounced back with flying colors in 2021, recording 100% results once again. Established in 2003, the institution has been steadfastly working towards its mission of guiding and empowering students towards excellence.
