        <h2>ZERO ERROR POLICY</h2>
        <p>
         KASH recognizes the far-reaching consequences that errors can have on students’ focus and determination. We put in best efforts to eliminate them as much as possible by adopting a zero error plan. Our Software personnels systematically list out different kinds of errors students make in their tests. An hour is dedicated for them to identify where they had gone wrong and practice the right methods of rectification. Depending upon subject-wise categories identified for errors, we compose questions of increasing levels around the same. Further counselling and training is provided in case of any ambiguity. This will not just effectively stop the error from recurring but will also make the entire error category dormant.
